Finalized things are
1. java springboot project per kaam ker rhe h(required to install jdk 17, eclipse, inside eclipse marketplace install this "spring tools 4(aka Spring tool suite 4)4.25.0 Release" and "jboss hibernate")
for the spring tool installation check only the default checkboxes and for jboss hibernate first uncheck all and then check only those which contains word hibernate and then proceed.
2. hibernate/jpa for database
3. jsp for frontend(this are made in src/main/resources here we create the hierarchy META-INF/resources/WEB-INF/jsp/then here we will save all the jsp pages) otherwise they won't be executed
4. Bcrypt algo for password encryption
5. Content(subject, body,attachments) encryption ke liye sir ko AES algo ka bola h toh yeh part ka analysis kerna h ki kon-kon si algorithms use kerna h
6. Java mail api for email transaction (smtp and imap protocols will be used) video reference codewithdurgesh
7. there we have a package in src/main/java i.e. com.privypost.main
	in that package we created 4 new packages that are:
	a) com.privypost.main.controller - 
	b) com.privypost.main.entity - here we will create all the classes(they will act as a table structure in database using hibernate with the same properties that we will declare in the class)
	c) com.privypost.main.repository - in this folder we will create the interfaces which are implemented by service class methods
	d) com.privypost.main.service- in this folder all the buisness logic inside the class 
8. pom.xml contains all the dependencies, I have added spring-boot-starter-web(as it is a web application), spring-boot-devtools(for automatic configuration), hibernate-core(for hibernate), spring-boot-starter-test(for testing purpose), tomcat-embed-jasper(for jsp pages configuration)
9. We can use spring-security for all session management things(not confirmed)
10. how we are going to provide two way authentication(to be discussed)
11. about public and private key how we are going to generate the key and how will we exchange it(to be discussed)
